			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site is to create a space where people who are searching for the right car to buy can have a list of different options that fit their needs. It is hard to find a place on the internet where you can put in your budget and get good feedback. This page will provide different options for each person.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>I intend this to be fore people who are searching for cars to buy. Probably people who know less about cars and in their early 20s.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>It will have three different forms that you will use to search for a good car. They will be the price, how reliable you want it, and user experience. The form will be like a triangle where you can only pick 2 out of the three things.</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/000000-feed1b-6e7e85-b7cece"
				target="_blank"
				>https://coolors.co/000000-feed1b-6e7e85-b7cece</a
			>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#000000]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#FEED1B]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#6E7E85]</td>
						<td class="accent2">[#B7CECE]</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->
             I chose these two fonts because they are bold and do not distract away from the main theme of the website. They feel strong and like they belong on a website built for trust.
			<h4>
				Heading Font: Arial Narrow
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Lato
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
